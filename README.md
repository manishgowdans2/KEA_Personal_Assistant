# KEA Personal Assistant

Application to help students especially for those who are new in filling the forms of KEA government applying for KCET exams because students face a lot of problem while filling due to lack of knowledge on things needed to be kept ready while filling the form and before they could fill the complete form, the server time exceeds and they have to wait a day or two to re-fill it.

Our application will contain a chat bot ![chat](https://github.com/manishgowdans2/KEA_Personal_Assistant/blob/master/readme_images/img4.png) where the user will ask set of questions and it will assist with whatever the things are needed to be kept ready and we will have a student database where the student can store and download all his information regarding the KCET form filled which can be later downloaded during the counselling time and we will have a real time chatting application where if the students doubts are not cleared by the bot then the user can ask any queries in the chat part where the user from the backend will respond and address his queries
